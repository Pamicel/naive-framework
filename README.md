# The not so naive framework

The objective of this project was to make the most declarative and simple to use boiler plate **I could** to build a project I had to do for school.

The project consisted of building a light _"Instagram-like"_ app. I was meant to use PHP (pure PHP, no frameworks or libraries), and the front end was to be pure Vanilla, HTML and CSS, and it had to be compatible with at least Chrome 41 and Firefox 46 (which is probably just an arbitrary constrain).

I don't like PHP that much, don't read me as a Javascript diehard, but I believe PHP (pure PHP with no framework or library that is) enforces concepts that are pretty antiquated. This is not something I felt like spending my learning time on. Moreover I had stumbled upon Vue a few months earlier, and the clarity and simplicity of it had really struck me, and emulating even a fraction of that was an achievement I wanted to pursue.

I essentially wanted to see how far I could go, with my basic understanding of JS, into building something that, even if it took more time to build, would _in fine_ simplify the development of the app.
